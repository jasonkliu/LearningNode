LearningNode
============

`brew install node`

Resources list:

1. The Art of Node (a short introduction)
`https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#the-art-of-node`
  * First, `learnyounode`. More interactive than Ruby Koans.
  `https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode#learn-you-the-nodejs-for-much-win`
    Difficulty seems to spike randomly so don't get discouraged.
  * Second, `stream-adventure`. Time to learn about streams.
  `https://github.com/substack/stream-adventure`
    Reference solutions are not long (for the most part) but it can be
	difficult to get your solution to match it, so it's often much longer.
